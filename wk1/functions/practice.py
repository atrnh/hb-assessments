# PART ONE

# 1. Write a function called 'hello_world' that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

def hello_world():
    """Print 'Hello World'"""

    print 'Hello World'


# 2. Write a function called 'say_hi' that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.

def say_hi(name):
    """Takes a name as a string and prints 'Hi' followed by the name"""

    print 'Hi %s' % name


# 3. Write a function called 'print_product' that takes two integers and
#    multiplies them together. Print the result.

def print_product(num1, num2):
    """Prints the product of two integers"""

    print num1 * num2


# 4. Write a function called 'repeat_string' that takes a string and an integer
#    and prints the string that many times

def repeat_string(string, num):
    """Takes a string and an integer and prints the string that many times"""

    print string * num


# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints
#    "Higher than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower than zero.
#    If the integer is zero, print "Zero".

def print_sign(num):
    """Takes an integer and prints if the integer is higher or lower than zero.

    It prints 'Higher than 0' if the integer is higher than zero, 'Lower
    than 0' if lower than zero.

#    and returns the number of spaces.

# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price
#    and a tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip percentage should
#    be optional; if not given, it should default to 15%.

#    argument and returns two pieces of information as strings --- "Positive"
#    or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings should be returned in
#    a list.

#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function on a number and
